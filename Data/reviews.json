We wasted 2 hours trying to sort out our booking and they wanted to move us to a 2 star hostel instead of the 4star apartment that we had booked. they told us that they werent any available rooms or apartment left, but when we try to search again via Booking.com and Agoda.com, both apartments and rooms are still available on the website during the duration of our stay. I have even paid everything in full 3 weeks prior to our trip and reconfirmed our reservations via email 3 times (final time with a response while the first 2 was ignored)\rEventhough the rooms are nice and the location is not bad. Do avoid at all cost if you do not want to end up almost spoiling your holiday. We have to delay our dinner reservations at very hard to book restaurant and lucky that they were able to accommodated us at a later time.\rHot water in the master bedroom is not consistent."

And I asked them for the second time why is the extra deposit ! They said it's just to guarantee their money... Would you imagine ! And another staff spoke to me on the phone said that I have to deposit 5,000 at least to accept my laundry otherwise they will not accept my cloths to be washed ! Wow ! ... In the end the manager came to my room and apologized to what happened he said the hotel was not clear about this thing and he just started to work in this hotel it's been around 3 months and the reason why he came because I requested him. By the way the laundry bill reached approximately 18,000 Baht when I checked out and it's been paid without any problems,  but this time what happened  during my stay was weird, strange... Ah let's not forget, the TV is not smart and small + the shower of the bathroom has to be covered by curtain to prevent water spreading. "

Daily breakfast was simply a great experience. HK team who cleaned our rooms for 4-days was AMAZING he was extremely friendly and is always with a happy smile and super polite.\nSpa receptionist was not available had to wait for 30-minutes plus and no one at the gym could assist. The pool area is run down and not maintained well, gazebos were mostly not available as they were damaged. Executive Lounge team and the VIP Check-In team are not friendly as the team at the normal reception counter. They were not attentive and did not converse while doing the arrival nor were welcoming when we proceeded to the Executive Lounge for refreshments or snack."

Breakfast is marvelous, everything is above standard. In addition, despite some of the lazy people I met, I met some wonderful staff too. The bellboy and the receptionist were so friendly\nThe waiter/waitress at breakfast are not exactly hard working. They never come to my table at all to clear any of the plates. However during my 4 nights stay, I was always given a big table therefore i can stack the plates on the empty space. The house keeping also can be improved a lot. My mom dropped a piece of cake with nut crumble on top on our first night there, we threw away the cake hoping that they would vacum the crumble. On our check out day, the crumbles were still there. The hotel does not have a direct elevator to the room. You have to change elevator from the lobby to go to the rooms. "

A nice personal gesture! \nThe check in & check out could have been smoother/quicker. When it was high volume of guests all waiting there was only 1-2 staff attending to everyone. Noticed you have a seperate side for Accor members. Suggestion when it is not busy /no guest to attend to at the Accor check in the staffers there can also help out at the normal front desk area.\nThe room:\nThe air con difference in the room is abit too drastic; can be adjusted more evenly. The bathroom should have a door to seperate the shower area.. If not one gets easily cold stepping out of the shower and it not a nice feeling! \nThe escalator connecting hotel to Platinum shopping mall is wonderful though the opening and closing time / when the escalator will stop - signage to be placed more prominently for guest information or placed in the rooms. \n"

There was always a pleasant smell in the foyer.\rThe room was quiet and beds comfy. The shower was good and there was a bath.\rRoom service was excellent. Normally we rarely use it, but because we were jet lagged we ordered food at unusual times and it was excellent, as was the food in the Sky bar.\rWiFi was consistently good.\rPrice was good compared to other 5 star hotels.\nThe room was no better than an average 4 star hotel. Tea and coffee making facilities were below that of a 3 star hotel. There was no milk to make a tea/coffee. We rang reception and was charged 120 bhat for a glass of milk so that we could have white tea/coffee, which for a 5 star hotel was very disappointing.\rThe TV had very limited channels.\rThe view from our room looked directly to another building. We kept the curtains closed so it didn\u2019t really bother us, but if you want a view check with the hotel first.\rBest to compare this hotel with other average 4 star hotels, that way it would be a very good choice.

Our suite also had a kitchenette and nice furniture. Robes, slippers, and nice toiletries as well. The breakfast and dinner buffet was expensive, but absolutely 5-stars-gourmet! The staff were kind and helpful. The river taxi was fun to use to go places. The pool is gorgeous, and the pool bar was fun.

I came many times in the last years in Bangkok, but this is the first time in this hotel, because I go normally in a different area. I had just one day to spend in Bangkok after my trip in Chiang Mai and I choose this hotel because it is along Chao Phraya river and in a quiet area of the city. I am fully satisfied of my choice: when I arrived I found very professional personnel and I appreciated a lot they allowed me to check in a bit earlier than normal time and to check out 2 hours later than normal time scheduled.\nThen: huge modern room, very comfy bed, big bathroom, balcony at a high floor with superb views all around, perfect cleanliness, free fruit plate in the room.\nBreakfast with wide choice of sweet treats and salted food, cooked food (rice, noodles, pasta, chicken, fish), yoghurt, cereals, smoothies, fresh fruit, egg station, ......\nThe last night I had dinner at restaurant River Barge and I experienced tasty Thai food, beautiful quite ambience, professional and discrete service by the waitress that served me. For dinner they have a wide buffet at a fixed price and as well A la Carte menu (I opted for it): you can it inside or outside, in the light evening breeze, looking at the river, the boats that pass on it and the stunning view all around.\nThe hotel has also a complimentary (and very frequent) service by boat from its pier to Saphan Taksin (and back, of course) where you can take the BTS Metro Station to go easily in any area of the city. \nIf I need in the future to come again to Bangkok and stay in that area, I'll choose for sure again this hotel. I have already recommended it to a couple of people that I know have plans to visit Bangkok within the next two years.\n\nNo complaint at all. Everything is fine and 100% adequate to the hotel standard. Unfortunately I could stay there only 1 day and 1 night (middle of March)"

My friend and I were very sad since our flight was moved up and we were only staying here half a night rather then a full night/day since it was such a nice hotel. Plenty of restaurants on site and really nice pool area. They upgraded us from a 1 bedroom to a 2 bedroom suite and it was honestly nicer then the apartments that we live in. It was massive with large comfortable beds! We even had 2 balconies with amazing views. The staff was very nice with easy check-in/out.\nWe didn't really go out an explore Bangkok since we were short on time so I can't comment on location, but they did have a personal hotel boat to bring guests to different areas on the river. The showers were very hard to get hot water, not sure if we weren't turning the nobs the right way or what was the issue, but eventually got hot water in 1 of the 2 showers."

We felt like clients at the service counter of a low-cost car hire company rather than at the desk of a four star hotel. We protested and after some time the people on the desk relented. We had similar feelings when we asked for a late checkout. This was kindly granted at half the rate of a  full booking. We were ok with that arrangment. When I noted the half day rate I was quoted was more than than half what we had paid for the room  we were told that the hotel was using the rate for the day. But when I (immediately) compared this rate  to Booking.com rate for the day I was surprised to learn the rate quoted was actually  higher that the Booking.com rate. We decided to leave things be."

There are many eateries around. This time, there was a street food market with live music, just at the end of the Soi.    Great experience as well. The reception organized a trip by long boat for us on the Chao Praya river which worked seamlessly (car and boat) as well as a private taxi to the airport.  The hotel has luggage storage as well.

Location is also ok (you can always take the mini shuttle they\u2019re providing every 10min to the main road/Terminal 21/Asok&Sukhumvit station).

The breakfast buffet and dinner at Giorgio restaurant are fine but not yet outstanding.\nCheck-in counter can be better managed. Based on my experience, customers wait in 3-4 separate lines and one can be served prior to the one who waits before because they happen to be in that line that goes faster. Sometimes the check-in and check-out can take longer than usual, so it can be frustrating to see that you are still waiting in line when others who come after you are being served first."

They have 2 chefs, one specializing in Asian cuisine, the other in making omelettes Western style.  The selection of food is glorious: fresh juice, waffles, pancakes made on the spot, pastries, rice soup (my wife's favorite), a selection of yogurts, fruit, vegetables, bacon, sliced cheese and meats, and an excellent array of Thai breakfast favorites.  The breakfast area has both indoor and outdoor seating, with a fabulous river view.  There are two swimming pools, one just above the river patio, the other across the way in an immaculately kept secluded garden area.  The hotel provides a free river boat shuttle that takes you to the nearest BTS station, a service we took advantage of quite often.  Free parking is provided, which is a must if you are crazy enough to drive to Bangkok (uh ... yes, call me crazy!).\nThis time around I wasn't careful in my booking and managed to secure a room but without the lovely breakfast.  Arghhh!!!  So I had to fork out extra to include the breakfast.  It so happened the hotel had a promotion, however, and we ended up having to only pay 400 THB each, whereas the normal price is a whopping (but well worth it) price of 800 THB.  So ... my main complaint would be that the Sheraton is a bit on the pricey side ... but well within the norm for this class of hotel in Bangkok, especially given its location directly on the main river."

On our first day we went down a bit later than normal due to being tired from traveling and by the time we'd sat down with an omelette they were clearing away so when they say breakfast ends at 10/1030, they really mean it. If you like to have a few breakfast rounds, I'd say leave an hour! \nThe gym is great, we used it quite late in the evenings and it was empty (joys of jetlag). For a hotel gym it is very well equipped with a number of different resistance machines as well as mix of weights and a Smith machine. We didn't use the pool but it looked nice. \nWe ate in Thara Thong one night and it was delicious but MEGA expensive. We'd only just arrived in Thailand as this was our first stop and had we been out and about we probably would have realised how expensive it was in comparison to out and about but the service was great, the restaurant has a lovely authentic feel to it that we didn't get anywhere else.

The level of service was excellent (99% of our stay) They were very friendly and very helpful, always smiling and in 2 instances anticipated the needs of my 87 year old mother who was travelling with us. These hard-working people makes me want to come back over and over. Kudos!\nThe service level was excellent just until we were about to get to the car as we left for the airport. All was good until this time. I was surprised since no other guests were leaving and there was a good number (3-4) of staff in the front door. Not a single one offered to help take our bags. Don't get me wrong, I don't really expect to be served hand and foot, but the the kind service that we got from day one, I half expected some one to help at that point. It made me feel a little like...\"hey you are already leaving our hotel, so we don't need to put our best foot forward.\rAlso I had an incident with my omelette tasting different (it was bad tomatoes as confirmed by the manager after she checked when I brought it) during one of my breakfasts."

I was worried, before arriving if this part of the city could be a good starting point to sightseeing the city but once we arrived we felt like was the best choice. We even had food stalls under the MBK center that were so cute. The surroundings are just perfect because there is everything you need and it's a nice neighborhood always crowded and safe.\nSkytrain and all public transport so much near. We honestly used most of the time taxis since they're so cheap and the hotel catches them for you. You can choose to get one with the taxi meter on or a fixed price. Our fare from the airport to the hotel was 350 bahts and hotel- airport was 340 plus highway tolls.\n- Everyone is friendly and help you with your needs without hesitation.\n- The room is very much clean and comfortable, beds are very good and they have a wide selection of pillows you can choose from. They give you free water bottles everyday.\n- Room service is amazing, their food is great and have good prices.\n- there is a 7 eleven two meters away which provides you everything you could ever need.\n- MBK center is in the same building of the hotel and has different entrances from inside so it's very comfortable doing some shopping there and bringing into the room the heavy bags before heading out again to visit the city.\n- The swimming pool is huge! Amazing and relaxing.\n- The quality of sleep is very good. You can set the temperature of the room as you like.\n-The room is so spacious and we'll equipped, you can open all the baggage you want.\n- Guests are sometimes way too loud at night when they come back or in the morning when they go away. This means that rooms must be better isolated.\n"

Got an extra bed with no charge.\rLocation is good too, just a 3min walk from the Thong-lo subway station, easy to get a Grab or taxi.\rHotel stores ur baggage after the check-out. It will be very useful if you have a night plane.\rStaffs were all friendly!\nI had to change the room right away after the late-night check-in due to the weird water dropping sound, \rfrom the bathroom and strange odor. Very tiring experience.\rIt was really hard to get a men's razor as an amenity. Called concierge and talked directly to the housekeeping lady, but couldn't get one during a 3night stay(miscommunication maybe? \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u017e)"

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, but the kicker was the Christmas morning breakfast buffet.  It was out of this world, and even included mince pies, which we dearly missed.\nThe traffic in Bangkok is horrendous.  It takes forever to get anywhere in a taxi.  Definitely worth figuring out the transport system."

The room itself was a good size, with nice bed view of the city especially from the bathroom where there was a nice tub and wet room style shower. The restaurant was nice and food pretty good,  with a spectacular view in a relaxed atmosphere, the bar on the very top had a incredible view of the city 360 degrees around. The pool on the 6th floor in the evening was empty and so we enjoyed a nice cooling swim, which was great.\nThe lighting for the pool area in the night was very bad, you could barely see anything around! The cost of the hotel, food and drinks I think is too high for Bangkok.. similar to prices at home in Switzerland, so this was a bit disappointing. My partner said that there was a bit of smell in the room..."

Late housekeeping service: we went out all day and came back at about 5 PM but the room had not been cleaned yet. Then the housekeeper arrived at 5-ish so we had to get out of the room again when we were super tired.\n2. The housekeeper did not restock the shower gel and shampoo for our 3-night stay. We had to ask the staff to bring it over during the night. This is not convenient.\n3. Water pressure and temperature not up to standard of a 4-5-star hotel. "

I am not sure if I would return with so many hotels that would probably give me the experience I expect in a however many stars hotel this place is. Thai people are also getting a 60% discount.\nI pulled up in a Toyota Fortuner with the audacity to be black and checking into such a place and the doorman, in Thai, asked the driver if I was checking in. I let him know that I was. He then passed my door without opening it as he had intended to do in the first place but then noticed that I am black and decided to skip it. Don't worry, I called him back to open the door. They also sent the cleaner to my room while I was getting ready to leave to ask me if I was checking out. I didn't understand why. When I said something to the front desk girl about it she raised her voice at me, pretty much the ultimate in rudeness in Thai culture.  I would say customer service is hit or miss. Cleanliness could have been better as well. There was a stain that looked like blood on the floor and cabinet of the bathroom in the first room they put me in and a white creamy stain appeared on the door while I was showering in the second."

Location is ideal, the hotel decor and grounds are exquisite and so inviting, rooms are well appointed and beds comfortable, but, most importantly, the welcoming staff and their attentive service make this a place you look forward to returning to after a day in the hustle and bustle of this amazing city! We would like to make a special note to mention our first encounter during check in with Ms. Rungaroon set the tone for our 5 night stay. Her polite demeanor and outstanding customer service, combined with the wonderful Thai warmth and hospitality, truly made our arrival at Siam Kempinski memorable. She then offered us an upgrade which made the stay all the more enjoyable! All these wonderful encounters and the attention to detail (too many to list!) make this THE ONLY place to stay! \nMaybe time to replace the rugs in the suites as they seemed worn out."

Liked the morning bubbles as well. Enjoyed free minibar of 2beers every day and other drinks as well. Will definitely visit again.\nThe hotel did not provide us information that we can take the buggie to Siam Station when we checked in.\nWe found out later when we asked the staff for the direction to the station before the footbridge to the shopping mall was opened.\nAlso the cleaning of room was not prompt as expected\nWhen we left the room around 10am we turned on the makeup room sign but the room was still not cleaned until 3pm. But seems like it was the full house so thats probably why. Despite these, very satisfied with the stay."

Most of the staff are friendly but it's hit and miss.  I think the staff could do with some additional training.\nThey require full payment in advance upon checkin + 2000 per day deposit.  So if you're staying 1 week, you're paying fully in advance and then also having a 14,000 baht hold on your credit card.  I think thats a ridiculous policy, given that it can take 3 weeks for that money to release on your card. I tried to discuss it with the front office manager but I found her to be a rude arrogant woman. I explained all other 5 star hotels I've been too don't operate this way. I tried to ask for the hotel manager, she tried to claim she's the hotel manager. Not so, since I met the hotel manager a few days earlier (a foreigner).\rThe fire alarm went off in the middle of the night across the entire hotel.  So the lobby was full of people. That's where I met the hotel manager mentioned above as he came in from home.  He said it's a malfunction and I noticed they had to kill the system for a day or two as the red light wasn't flashing on the smoke detector.\rThey have a silly policy of not allowing grab or foodpanda riders to simply ride up to the front of the hotel to deliver food.  Security force them to go around the back of the hotel through boom gates, get a parking card, and all this rubbish.  Completely unnecessary and confusing for the riders and the guests.\rThey claim the restaurant is open 24 hours for room service.  In actual fact the restaurant closes at 9pm and if you order food after 9pm you can only choose from the \"night menu\" which has about 5 things on it.  No Thai food whatsoever. Only Burgers, pasta, that type of stuff.  The stuff an assistant can heat in the microwave."

But all other door was closed. So I did not go out anywhere after once I saw it. the other girl stuff also made face of telling wifi password after check out to call grab, and did not answer \"You are welcome\" nor anything after I said \"Thank you\". 5 star? Really?\r Pool was needed to precook so not flexible.\rNo corona partition at lobby and full of people speaking anywhere."

This was disappointing as when I reported this to reception they just said sorry they didn\u2019t even take off the bill. \nThe second was they tried to over bill me in the cooling tower I also wanted to reserve the table with the best view as was my birthday and had friends coming and even though I was a guest they gave booking to outside party who were not staying in the hotel this is quite disappointing for a hotel being 5 stars as guests should always be given priority. \nThis was added too a disappointment as they could not even get us a table in the Cantonese restaurant even though we asked two days prior."

I was in a rush for a meeting - advising your staff that I'll come by to finish and they kept the food for me and delivered to my room thank you. I arrived before check in time and the reception & hk managed to get me a room in time for my meeting at 2pm thx!\nThe service for breakfast wasn't really good. Maybe I was there at 9:40am almost closing time. The toasts came out first with no utensils until I had to ask for them. Not a big problem but I expect to have that part of a service mind. The scrambled eggs came out cold though. The Cesar salad dressing was way too sour. You may be asking well I did finish the food, yes because I was hungry. One of the waiters serving water spilled some water on my table without apologising and rushing away. Anyways breakfast this time is not so good - the quality and the service. On Saturday night, I honestly expected a lot for the cooling tower. Unfortunately the location of the seats are just ridiculous especially a long sofa in which it should be facing the view outside not inside facing other guests. Didn't like the mojito ordered - i should have told the bartender but it's ok not a big deal. The staff was good though - very attentive thank you!"

You can travel via MRT or BTS to Jatujak weekend market for less than 5 minutes.\rFor the hotel quality, the pool is very well maintained. The room features a large screen smart TV which you can watch Youtube and enjoy that entertainment in a nice comfortable well docorated room.\nOn the first day my bedsheet had some yellow/red stain on it. It was a light small stain but it looked pretty much like period.\rIt was changed the day after but I'd say the 4-star hotel of this standard should pay more attention to details, because this stain issue could upset a lot of hotel guests."

There is no netflix or other entertainment applications except youtube on the tv, and I can't install it on tv by myself. I think it would be great if we could spend time with our lover or friends by watching some movies in the hotel room because we can't do other activities like going to the pool, the club or shopping due to COVID-19. (The reason why i don't answer this paragraph on the dislike topic is because it doesn't like I dislike it at all. I enjoyed watching YouTube, but if there had been more choices, there would have been better.)"

The bed was comfortable but the room was small and oddly laid out wasting some of the space.

Our only real complaint would be with the Wi-Fi in this room didn't work very well - kept cutting out and on returning to our room we had to log back in."

The views from my balcony were amazing I loved my stay overall. Everything close by via taxi no more than 15-20 mins away. Lots of food stalls walkable distance however. There is a boat service near the pier that can take you to the shopping mall. One of main reason booking lebua was for the sky bar. And gym facilities.\nThe second day of our stay the gym was flooded and was not useable this is one of the main reason for choosing lebua yet I didn\u2019t get to use the gym but no discounts were given for this disruption. Secondly the skybar drinks are extremely overpriced 1800 baht per drink was the cheapest. Many other amazing skybars with music etc for alot less in Bangkok.I understand the hangover was filmed here but it was too pricey and empty may i add. It didn\u2019t feel like a bar as not many people went up there. Also upon arrival at check in they ask for a 10,000 baht deposit, if you give this in cash as i did u get it back on the day, card payments will take 5-7 days to be returned. Can\u2019t comment on food services at hospital as didn\u2019t use it."

The location is perfect in the old commercial hub of BK with an array of activities, drinking and eating around you (they make much of their Michelin stars there are several others within a kilometre and many Michelin recommended venues within 200m). Lebua gave us a great start to BK and a grand jump-off point for the rest of the city and beyond\nAnd here\u2019s where it cuts. The suite was dated and lacked the facilities I expect from an hotel of this class - no modern conveniences (USB charging, functional WiFi, functional coffee) but I wonder if that was because we were a lower floor, superior suite. Having stayed at the Marina Bay Sands (my bar now for these establishments) Lebua State Tower drew short. \nBut hey, it was \u00a390 a night so what do we expect...\nWell, yes, that would be fair until you try to experience the Skybar. As residents we were still shuttled into the holding pen of Distil with the walk-in trade, and there was no option to skip the queue (as in MBS). For an iconic venue where people literally stay in the establishment for that caveat... I was a bit irritated by this. You buy a (grotesquely priced) cocktail and once finished you are ushered into the skybar (but only photos in certain spots please...).  Walk in trade; fine I get that. It costs a lot to maintain an iconic venue and you can\u2019t lose out to opportunist selfie hunters, but your guests have already funnelled several hundred pounds into your tills... we\u2019d appreciate a little understanding for that. \nBut the markets the market. Lebua clearly aim their lower tier suites at basic travellers seeking a status symbol check in for a short stay. I raise my hand - I am that basic bitch. But at the same time, I could have halved my bill and stayed in the Marriott down the road. Instead I chose an iconic venue and feel a little taken-advantage-of. \nIf Lebua don\u2019t want riffraff like me than upgrade your rooms, triple your rates to Shangri-La levels, and charge me B1000 to come up the lift and take a photo on the terrace.

The rooftop bar is even worse. \u00a360 for a basic and I mean basic gin and tonic and one cocktail. We stayed for one and then left. We were also told we couldn\u2019t take pictures until we had been to the bar so don\u2019t expect to just go up to enjoy the view and leave again, even as a hotel guest. The soundproofing between the rooms is terrible. We had a couple next to us arguing into the early hours of the morning and then let\u2019s just say we heard them make up again.

            "description": "Outstanding service from staff, from the minute you arrive to check out. They really do know how to make guests feel welcome. Nice room, great view. Breakfast selection was the best we\u00b4ve ever seen.\nThere\u00b4s a certain cagey-ness to visiting the onsite restaurants. Very disappointing in fact. \rWhen you arrive you are given a beautiful map and brochure advertising the various bars & restaurants on site. However - try find a menu and pricing - it\u00b4s nigh impossible. So we followed dress code rules etc, which is no problem at all and asked to go for a drink at the famed Sky Bar on one evening of our stay.\rWe were whisked up to the top floor, only to then be dropped two floors down and taken to their Pink Champagne Bar - where we were led to a table & pressed repeatedly to stay and enjoy the view there. We said over & over no thanks & left the Pink Bar asking again to be taken to the Sky bar. So we go up again, and then are led YET again into another bar - this time the Whisky bar. Again NOT where we wanted to be. At this point we had a menu shoved in our face and we were told that ONLY if we order a drink at this bar we could go to the Sky Bar. WHAT?\rSo we left - disgruntled to say the least. Before going back down, I managed to enter Scirocco and the Sky Bar area - but after having been shoved and pushed around - where the aim was definitely to force you to order OVER priced drinks at numerous bars before giving you what you want - we decided against eating at their restaurant the next night and left feeling rather disgusted at the service. \rWe were paying to be in the hotel - we were not riff raff off the street. \rThe sneakiness of also not allowing guests to see the menu before making a reservation at the restaurants (for which you must also pay a deposit - even if you are already a hotel guest who has ALREADY paid a deposit on check in of 10,000 Baht) - is also rude. I struggle to understand why they would not publish their menus and pricing - would they rather embarrass their guests when they realise that dinner may cost more than they realise? \rI have been to many Chefs Table and fine dining restaurants - & never been treated this way."

That\u2019s without the extra 10% service and 7% service charge.\rWe were hotel residents and visited the sky bar and they took us to the other bars on the way trying to get us to buy drinks in the pink bar, in the whiskey bar, we had to be really firm in the end to go to the top, which spoiled it a bit"

The Breakfast was incredible with a choice of food to suit all tastes & cultures. The rooftop sky bar/restaurant was surreal with amazing panoramic views of the city.\nWe didn't have a kettle in our room when we arrived but one was provided on request. Frankly, there's not much not to like about this hotel!"

But it\u2019s really pricey, it\u2019s really for just being there and seeing the view and beautiful people. Food in small portions because people really don\u2019t want to eat. Room was ok this time. Seemed like I was more impressed last time. \nI was less impressed with my room this time, I guess I should remember the ones I liked and what they were called, but who does that. "

The concierge staff were amazing making sure that we had metered taxis and relaxation expectations of costing for tuk tuks \nhowever there were elements of the staff being pushy to get us to spend big up at the sky bar. We felt forced into making a booking at Breeze, which we had to cancel as we didn\u2019t want to fork out over $500 for two people to eat. Also we booked for two double beds but upon arrival they only had a king bed available."
